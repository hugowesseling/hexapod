Installed apache2:
apt-get install apache2

Added python handling as described in:
http://raspberrywebserver.com/cgiscripting/writing-cgi-scripts-in-python.html
(Write "AddHandler cgi-script .py" in one of the directory xml parts of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default)


Allow execution of cgi scripts in that directory:
Add "Options ExecCGI" to that directory xml part in the config file

Restart server:
service apache2 reload

Now in each script write:
#!/usr/bin/env python

Make all the scripts executable (chmod +x *.py)
